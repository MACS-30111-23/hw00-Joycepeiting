##  Summary and Reflection

I separated homework1 into 2 main sections, (1) biography and (2) summary/reflection. 

In the biography section, I inserted a block to give a general self-introduction. Afterwards, I listed more details about my background and interests with ordered and non-ordered lists, respectively. 

For the interest part, as I wanted to indent some texts, I added "&nbsp" to some lines. I reviewed how to input images and links in the text, which would be helpful to further application in other documents. 

Overall, it was a great review of how to use markdown. I also learned some new syntax, such as adding a blockquote using ">".
